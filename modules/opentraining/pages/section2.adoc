= Identify training requirement

The training you wish to contribute could originate from several sources:

* You may identify a knowledge gap based on your own experience.
* You might notice a gap within your team that you want to address through training.
* You may receive a request from another team, partner, or customer for specific training.
* You could find a training topic in our backlog (FIXME link) that interests you and would like to contribute to.
